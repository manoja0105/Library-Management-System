# Library Management System

## 1. Project Title

**Library Management System**

---

## 2. Project Description

The Library Management System is a web-based application developed to help a librarian manage library books, students, borrowing and returning activities, book hold requests, email notifications, and reports.

The system provides a simple and organized way to maintain library records and reduce manual work. The librarian can manage books and student information, issue books, record returned books, manage book hold requests, search available books, and generate reports.

The system also provides a public book-search interface where registered students can place a temporary hold on an available book. When a book is held, the available quantity is updated immediately. An email notification is sent to the student through SMTP when the hold is approaching its expiry time.

Book holds automatically expire after the configured hold period if the student does not borrow the book. The automatic notification and expiry processes are handled using PHP scripts and Windows Task Scheduler.

# 3. Problem Statement

Traditional library management methods often depend on manual records, which can make it difficult to maintain accurate information about books, students, and borrowing activities.

Manual record keeping can also result in:

* Difficulty finding book information
* Difficulty tracking borrowed and returned books
* Errors in maintaining student records
* Time-consuming record management
* Difficulty preparing library reports
* Problems identifying available books
* Difficulty managing temporary book reservations
* Delays in notifying students about held books
* Difficulty tracking expired book holds

Therefore, a computerized Library Management System is required to manage these activities efficiently.

* To develop a simple web-based Library Management System.
* To maintain accurate book records.
* To maintain student/member records.
* To manage book issuing and returning.

---

# 10. Installation and Setup

## Step 1: Install XAMPP

Install XAMPP with:

* Apache
* MySQL
* PHP

## Step 2: Copy the Project

Copy the project folder into the XAMPP `htdocs` directory.

Example:

```text
C:\XAMP\htdocs\Library Management System
```

## Step 3: Start XAMPP

Start:

* Apache
* MySQL

## Step 4: Create the Database

Open phpMyAdmin and import:

```text
schema.sql
seed.sql
```

This will create the required database and tables.

## Step 5: Configure Database Connection

Check:

```text
config/db.php
```

Make sure the database connection details match the local XAMPP configuration.

## Step 6: Install PHPMailer

The project uses Composer and PHPMailer for SMTP email notifications.

The required Composer packages are stored inside:

```text
vendor/
```

Open Command Prompt.

Check Composer:

composer --version

Install PHPMailer:

composer require phpmailer/phpmailer

Make sure the following file exists:

vendor/autoload.php

The project uses PHPMailer with SMTP for email notifications.

The system does not use PHP mail().

## Step 7: Configure SMTP

Configure the SMTP settings used by PHPMailer.

The SMTP configuration contains the required:

* SMTP host
* SMTP port
* SMTP username
* SMTP password/app password
* Sender email address
* Sender name

The application uses SMTP instead of PHP `mail()`.

## Step 8: Configure Automatic Hold Processing

The system contains PHP scripts for automatic hold processing:


scripts/send_hold_notifications.php
scripts/expire_holds.php


The notification script checks active holds that have reached their reminder time and sends the email notification.

The expiry script checks active holds whose expiry time has been reached and changes their status to `EXPIRED`.

## Step 9: Configure Windows Task Scheduler

Windows Task Scheduler is configured to run the PHP scripts automatically.
 
  Create Notification Task

First open:

Task Scheduler

Then:

Task Scheduler Library
        ↓
Action
        ↓

Program/script

Use the PHP executable:

C:\xampp\php\php.exe
Add arguments
"C:\xampp\htdocs\Library Management System\scripts\send_hold_notifications.php"
Start in
C:\xampp\htdocs\Library Management System

Click:OK


Conditions 

Open the Conditions tab.

Important:

Leave all options unchecked.

Do not select:

Start the task only if the computer is on AC power

or other unnecessary conditions.


Settings

Use the following settings:

☑ Allow task to be run on demand
☑ Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed

For task failure:

☑ If the task fails, restart every:

1 minute

Set:

Attempt to restart up to:

3 times

Select:

☑ If the running task does not end when requested,
   force it to stop

For multiple instances:

If the task is already running:

Do not start a new instance

Click: OK



The Library Hold Notification task is now configured.



    Create Expiry Task

Create another Task Scheduler task.

Go to:

Task Scheduler
        ↓
Task Scheduler Library
        ↓
Action
        ↓
Create Task

Create:

Library Hold Expiry
General

Set:

Name:
Library Hold Expiry

Select:

Run whether user is logged on or not

Select:

Run with highest privileges
Triggers → New

Select:

Begin the task:
On a schedule

Set:

Daily: ✓

Set:

Repeat task every:
1 minute

Set:

For a duration:

Make sure:

Enabled: ✓

Click:

OK
Actions → New

Select:

Action:
Start a program
Program/script
C:\xampp\php\php.exe
Add arguments
"C:\xampp\htdocs\Library Management System\scripts\expire_holds.php"
Start in
C:\xampp\htdocs\Library Management System

Click:OK



Conditions

Open the Conditions tab.

Important:

Leave all options unchecked.

Settings

Use:

☑ Allow task to be run on demand
☑ Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed

For task failure:

☑ If the task fails, restart every:

1 minute

Set:

Attempt to restart up to:

3 times

Select:

☑ If the running task does not end when requested,
   force it to stop

For multiple instances:

If the task is already running:

Do not start a new instance

Click:OK



The Library Hold Expiry task is now configured.

   Check Task Scheduler

The Task Scheduler Library should contain:

Library Hold Notification
Library Hold Expiry

Both tasks should show:

Status: Ready

The tasks should run every:

1 minute

You can also right-click each task and select:

Run

to test it manually.

The tasks can be configured to run every minute so that hold reminders and expiry processing are handled automatically.

## Step 10: Run the System

Open the project in a web browser.

Example:

```text
http://localhost/Library%20Management%20System/
```
